    they need for digestion.' ` },

    "Good morning," he said.
    He was standing before a garden, all a−bloom with roses.
    "Good morning," said the roses.
    The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower.
    "Who are you?" he demanded, thunderstruck.
    "We are roses," the roses said.
    And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only
    one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike,
    in one single garden!` },
